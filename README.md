# Which Automotive Brand is the Funniest?

This is a simple and fun web app that lets you choose a car brand and then shows you a random joke or trivia fact. The app is built using Vite, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It uses free APIs to get random facts and jokes. All jokes and facts appear in a popup modal with buttons that let users react to what they read.

## Live Demo

You can view the project here:

## Disclaimer

Sometimes the app might not load a fact or joke right away, especially the first few times you run it. This can happen because of how the APIs respond. If this happens, be patient and try clicking the button again or choosing a different brand from the dropdown. The app uses a backup joke list if needed.

## APIs Used in This Project

1. **JokeAPI**  
This gives a random joke in plain text. The app uses the safe-mode version.  
Link: https://jokeapi.dev/

2. **NHTSA Vehicle API**  
This is used to load a full list of car makes (brands) for the dropdown.  
Link: https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/

If the JokeAPI fails or returns nothing, the app uses a backup list of jokes.
